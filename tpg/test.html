      <p>Top Glove Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest rubber-glove maker, said its 
        profit dropped for a second successive quarter in the three months ended 
        Nov. 30 on higher latex costs and a weaker U.S. dollar.</p>
      <p>Net income fell 45 percent to 36.1 million ringgit ($11.5 million) in 
        its fiscal first quarter, the Malaysian company said in an exchange filing 
        today. Average latex prices were 57 percent higher than a year ago, while 
        the dollar was 9.3 percent weaker against the ringgit, said Top Glove, 
        which sells its products in the U.S. currency.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Top Glove will continue to share some of these higher costs with 
        its customers, even though there will be a time lag for the high cost 
        to be passed down to them,&#8221; it said.</p>
      <p>The Selangor-based company&#8217;s shares surged 188 percent last year 
        as global demand for medical rubber gloves outstripped supply amid a wave 
        of global flu scares. Manufacturers, including Top Glove, responded by 
        adding production lines as international H1N1 flu outbreaks began to ebb.</p>
      <p>Its shares fell 1.8 percent to 5.40 ringgit at 3:52 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur 
        today. The company released its earnings during the midday trading break.</p>
      <p>Sales climbed 4 percent during the quarter to 491.5 million ringgit. 
        Demand has been &#8220;normalizing with the excess capacity situation,&#8221; 
        the statement said.</p>
      <p>The company reported a 21 percent drop in profit to 45.1 million ringgit 
        in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Aug. 31.</p>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD&#8217;s earnings fell 44% to 
        RM36.05 million for the first quarter ended Nov 30 from RM65.21 million 
        a year ago as it was impacted by the high latex prices and a weak US dollar.</p>
      <p>It said on Wednesday, Dec 13 revenue rose 4% to RM491.51 million from 
        RM472.30 million while earnings per share were 5.83 sen compared with 
        10.76 sen.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>&#8220;The three months to Nov 30, 2010 has been a challenging quarter 
        for the group due to headwinds such as persistently high latex prices 
        and the continued weakening of the US dollar coupled with the time lag 
        in passing on the higher costs to its customers, which have affected the 
        group&#8217;s profit margins,&#8221; it said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Top Glove said average latex prices rose by 57% from RM4.58 per kg in 
        1Q2010 to RM7.20 per kg in 1Q2011 while the average US dollar weakened 
        against the ringgit by 9.3% (RM3.43 in 1Q2010 versus RM3.11 in 1Q2011).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The world&#8217;s largest glove manufacturer said demand for rubber gloves, 
        which has been normalising coupled with the excess capacity situation, 
        have also impacted the industry.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It also said customers kept their inventory level at a minimum level 
        due to high selling prices of latex gloves, which reflected the increasing 
        cost of latex prices.</p>

      <p>The natural rubber (NR) industry, after a rally this year, can expect 
        another buoyant year in 2011, says the Malaysian Rubber Board (MRB).</p>
      <p>Tight global supply, declining stocks and seemingly unstoppable growth 
        of China and India point towards a buoyant 2011 for the industry, MRB 
        said.</p>
      <p>The price of SMR (Standard Malaysian Rubber) 20 was at a new historic 
        high of RM13.35 per kg on November 11 this year.</p>
      <p>China and India will continue to be the main focus for the NR market 
        as their automotive industries are poised to register double-digit growth, 
        at least in the next two years, MRB said in a statement yesterday.</p>
      <p>The board said the rally in 2010 had been bullish due principally to 
        tight supplies, speculative rubber futures, impact of Thailand's imposition 
        of a new cess effective October 1 and dwindling stocks in major producing 
        and consuming countries.</p>
      <p>&quot;In recent months, output has been affected by abnormal rainfall. 
        Local prices are also boosted by the strengthening of the ringgit.&quot;</p>
      <p>MRB said worldwide stock levels were at all-time low and Malaysia's rubber 
        stockpile was equivalent to five weeks of world demand, compared to 10 
        weeks in the past.</p>
      <p>&quot;Contributing factors include abnormally heavy rainfall and flood 
        affecting producing countries.&quot;</p>
      <p>MRB said the seasonal lull of wintering from January to March is set 
        to reduce the country's output further by up to 40 per cent.</p>
      <p>Rubber planting and tapping are seen a useful strategy to alleviate poverty 
        among rural folks and bridge the income level gap with urban dwellers.</p>
      <p>As much as 95 per cent of land planted with rubber trees in Malaysia 
        is tapped by smallholders.</p>
      <p>MRB said almost half of smallholders in Malaysia are solely dependent 
        on rubber tapping for their income.</p>
      <p>The board noted that higher rubber prices in the international markets 
        had resulted in smallholders securing monthly income of RM2,000 to RM3,000.</p>
      <p>High rubber prices, since 2006, also have prompted hijackings of latex-filled 
        tankers and theft of cup lumps.</p>
      <p>MRB acknowledged that thefts are more rampant in times of high rubber 
        prices.</p>
      <p>The regulator has warned the industry not to take in latex that is suspected 
        to be hijacked or stolen.</p>
      <p>It said it will suspend or cancel licences issued if persons caught were 
        found to be guilty.</p>
      <p>It is common knowledge that rising rubber prices tempt suppliers to default 
        on lower-priced contracts.</p>
      <p>MRB has also warned rubber exporters not to defer shipment or cancel 
        contracts.</p>

      Regionally 
      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, June 24 (Bernama) -- Top Glove Corporation Bhd, the world's 
        largest rubber glove manufacturer, is looking at possible acquisitions 
        in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Its Chairman, Tan Sri Lim Wee Chai, said the company was currently in 
        talks with potential parties and expected deals to be concluded or finalised 
        within a year.</p>
      <p>&quot;As of now, we have committed RM80 million for ongoing expansion 
        in new factories and production lines in Malaysia and Thailand to boost 
        our capacity from 33 billion pieces per annum to 41.25 billion pieces 
        per annum by 2011,&quot; Lim said during an analysts' briefing on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Currently, Top Glove has 20 manufacturing facilities spread over Malaysia, 
        Thailand and China.</p>
      <p>Lim said Top Glove was bullish of its financial performance in the current 
        financial year ending August 31, 2010 given the growing global demand 
        for rubber gloves due to the H1N1 epidemic.</p>
      <p>&quot;Net profit may surge between 70 per cent and 80 per cent during 
        that period.</p>
      <p>&quot;Overall, we have maintained an average profit margin of eight to 
        10 per cent over the last 10 years.</p>
      <p>&quot;For this year and 2011, we are confident of maintaining these numbers,&quot; 
        Lim added.</p>
      <p>As for profit after tax, Top Glove had achieved an annual compound growth 
        rate of 36 per cent since 2001.</p>
      <p>&quot;We are happy if we can achieve at least 20 per cent growth rate, 
        moving forward in the coming years,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>Top Glove chalked up a pre-tax profit of RM263.9 million, up 85 per cent 
        for the nine-months ended May 31, 2010, against RM142.5 million achieved 
        during the corresponding period.</p>
      <p>Lim said the nine-month period was challenging for Top Glove as latex 
        prices had surged from a low of RM4.97 per kg, in November 2009, to RM7.20 
        per kg, as at June 18, 2010.</p>

      <p>Top Glove Corp Bhd (7113), the world's biggest rubber glove maker, continued 
        its strong run as third quarter net profit jumped 53 per cent thanks to 
        resilient demand.</p>
      <p>Malaysia's rubber glove producers have been enjoying good profits since 
        influenza A (H1N1) was declared a pandemic last year.</p>
      <p>&quot; ... the group is confident of continuous growth and good profitable 
        performance in this financial year ended August 31 2010,&quot; it said 
        in a statement to Bursa Malaysia yesterday.</p>
      <p>Top Glove's net profit for the quarter to May 31 2010 was RM64.48 million 
        against RM42.2 million. Revenue jumped 49 per cent to RM555.9 million.</p>
      <p>The rubber glove maker said it is experiencing strong profit growth momentum 
        as demand for gloves continues to increase, especially from the emerging 
        markets.<br>
        In the first nine months to May 2010, its net profit jumped 78 per cent 
        to RM200.22 million from a year ago. Revenue for the nine months rose 
        39 per cent to RM1.54 billion from RM1.11 billion a year ago.</p>
      <p>Its balance sheet strengthened further with a net cash position of RM273 
        million and free cash flow of RM147.2 million for the period ended May 
        31 2010. It also fully redeemed some RM35 million bonds before its maturity 
        in December 2010.</p>
      <p>During the quarter, 1.37 million treasury shares were sold in the open 
        market for RM17.28 million. Subsequent to May 31, a total of 5.25 million 
        treasury shares were disposed for RM64.49 million.</p>
      <p>Top Glove has done well despite latex prices spiking 24 per cent and 
        the US dollar weakening by 3 per cent.</p>
      <p>This year, it expects to return 40 per cent of its profits to investors.</p>

      <p>Top Glove Pre-tax Profit Up 85 Per Cent To RM263.9 Million</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 (Bernama) -- Top Glove Corp Bhd's pre-tax profit 
        for nine months ended May 31, 2010 rose by 85 per cent to RM263.9 million 
        from RM142.5 million in the same period of 2009.</p>
      <p>Revenue rose by 39 per cent to RM1.54 billion from RM1.10 billion in 
        the same period last year, it said in a statement here Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Top Glove said the strong profit growth momentum was due to the increase 
        in demand for gloves, especially from the emerging markets.</p>
      <p>&quot;The company also benefited from cost-saving measures implemented 
        at all factories, improvements in product quality, productivity, as well 
        as aggressive marketing strategies to maintain its world number one market 
        position,&quot; it said.</p>
      <p>The company said it was optimistic of its outlook despite the increase 
        in raw material costs and the weakening of US dollar.</p>
      <p>&quot;With a large customer base in over 180 countries, a diversified 
        range of good quality products and a dedicated team, the group is confident 
        of continuous growth and a profitable performance for financial year ended 
        Aug 31, 2010,&quot; it said.</p>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: CIMB Equities Research is maintaining its Outperform call

        premium over its target market P/E of 15 times.</p>
      <p>It said on Thursday, March 11 factors that could extend the re-rating 
        of the stock include another potential round of strong results, the continuing 
        uptick in glove demand and Top Glove's upcoming capacity expansion. The 
        report was issued ahead of Top Glove's release of its 2QFY8/10 results 
        on March 17.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Given the full utilisation of its latest factory and potential 
        higher contribution from its Mediflex subsidiary, we believe that Top 
        Glove could report 2Q earnings that are almost double the year-ago level 
        and at least 5% higher than 1QFY10's earnings,&#8221; it said.</p>
      <p>Annualised 1H net profit is expected to exceed CIMB Research&#8217;s 
        estimate of RM260 million as it expects stronger earnings in the remaining 
        quarters given the additional capacity coming in during 2H.</p>

      <p>Top Glove Bhd, the world&#8217;s largest rubber-glove maker, aims to 
        match last year&#8217;s dividend payment of 40 per cent of its profit.</p>
      <p>&#8220;We have better profit, good cash flow and a very healthy balance 
        sheet,&#8221; Chairman Lim Wee Chai said in an interview in Kuala Lumpur 
        today.</p>
      <p>The Malaysian company raised its dividend distribution ratio to 40 per 
        cent last year from 30 per cent as profits surged and the global flu outbreak 
        bolstered demand for its disposable gloves.</p>
      <p>Its profit has climbed by an average annual compounded annual rate of 
        36 percent in the past 15 years, Lim said. Net income gained 54 per cent 
        to RM169.1 million in 2009.</p>
      <p>Top Glove aims to achieve analysts&#8217; consensus net profit forecast 
        of RM250 million this year, or a 48 per cent increase, Lim said.</p>
      <p>&#8220;To maintain this, we need both organic and acquisition growth,&#8221; 
        he said.</p>
      <p>The manufacturer has cash holdings of RM250 million. It aims to spend 
        100 million ringgit of this on acquisitions and RM80 million on organic 
        growth, Lim said, adding that the company doesn&#8217;t plan to borrow 
        or sell debt.</p>
      <p>Top Glove is looking at companies or factories to buy in Indonesia, Thailand 
        and Vietnam as well as in its home Malaysian market, Lim said, adding 
        that Top Glove hopes to make its first acquisition this year.</p>
      <p>The stock advanced 2.6 per cent to RM11.76 at midday, set for a record.</p>
      <p>The shares have more than doubled in the past 12 months, outpacing the 
        50 per cent increase in the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index over 
        the past 12 months, surging 181 per cent.</p>
      <p>&#8220;We have earned it,&#8221; Lim said, referring to the share price 
        surge. - Bloomberg</p>

      <p>We wish to provide several clarifications on the article entitled Tillotson 
        case shows united stand by glove makers on page B2 of StarBiz on Jan 5, 
        2010.</p>
      <p>It is correct that quite a number of &#8220;Respondents&#8221; participated 
        in the ITC&#8217;s investigation, challenging the Tillotson&#8217;s allegation 
        of patent infringement.</p>
      <p>But by the time of the appeal to the CAFC, the only parties defending 
        the ITC&#8217;s favourable decision were Smart Glove, Henry Schein and 
        the ITC&#8217;s General Counsel.</p>
      <p>The US distributors Ansell and Cardinal, which had worked actively at 
        the ITC, settled. And the remaining Respondents simply did not participate 
        in the appeal.</p>
      <p>Certainly, Smart Glove and its partners, which shouldered the burden 
        at the appeal, are entitled to congratulations for their success against 
        the Tillotson patent.</p>
      <p>Had Tillotson won the case, the ITC could have excluded the accused gloves 
        from entry into the US and forbid the sale of gloves already in the US.</p>
      <p>I would like to add that the CAFC decided the case in record time &#8211;

      <p>Shares of rubber glove makers had a good run yesterday after an analyst 
        said they are still cheap relative to their future earnings.</p>
      <p>About half of yesterday's top 10 gainers were rubber glove makers. Among 
        them, Rubberex Corp Bhd (7803) jumped the most, gaining 18 per cent to 
        RM2.75, followed by Supermax Corp Bhd with a 14 per cent rise to RM5.35.</p>
      <p>Rubber glove makers had a good year in 2009 as their stocks did better 
        than the broader market's 45 per cent gain.</p>
      <p>But CIMB's head of research Terence Wong said in a report that they are 
        set for another good run this year, helped by higher demand due to rising 
        population, hygiene awareness and stricter health rules.</p>
      <p>The stocks are also cheap as the sector's average price multiple, at 
        9.4 times 2010 earnings, are about half the peak recorded in 2006/2007.<br>
        &quot;We believe that the rubber glove companies are still undervalued 
        and offer tremendous earnings upside due to their expansion programmes,&quot; 
        he said.</p>
      <p>Demand should stay resilient.</p>
      <p>&quot;Demand for rubber gloves is expected to be strong over the next 
        few years. Malaysian glove makers predominantly manufacture examination 
        and medical-grade gloves which make up on average 90 per cent of their 
        output.</p>
      <p>&quot;Rubber glove will remain as protection against the spread of diseases, 
        especially for healthcare workers. We believe demand will not only be 
        resilient but will continue to grow along with hygiene awareness, health 
        regulations and population size,&quot; added Wong.</p>
      <p>CIMB has &quot;outperform&quot; recommendations on all the rubber glove 
        makers under its coverage, with Supermax and Adventa its top picks. It 
        has a target price of RM7.96 for Supermax, RM5.44 for Adventa, Top Glove 
        (RM15.90), Latexx (RM4.36), Kossan (RM5.49), and Hartalega (RM11.24).</p>

        rubber glove makers are willing to pay the market price for natural gas, 
        over a period of time, but the government needs to guarantee that they 
        will have enough supply.</p>
      <p>&quot;We are willing to pay market price, on a phase-by-phase approach,&quot; 
        Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers' Association president Lee Kim Meow 
        said.</p>
      <p>&quot;We appeal to the government to allocate more natural gas to our 
        sector as we're fast becoming a significant contributor to the country's 
        exports,&quot; he told Business Times in an interview in Petaling Jaya, 
        Selangor.</p>
      <p>Manufacturers like glovemakers and ceramic producers use gas as their 
        main fuel source.</p>
      <p><img src="news/pix_topright.jpg" width="200" height="162"><br>
        <br>
        Currently, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) has fixed the annual supply 
        of gas to industries in Peninsular Malaysia and the bulk, or about 63 
        per cent, goes to the power plants.</p>
      <p>The manufacturing sector uses another 11.6 per cent of natural gas.</p>
      <p>&quot;Many of our members are unable to expand like before because there 
        is uncertainty in supply of natural gas and foreign labour,&quot; Lee 
        said.</p>
      <p>At present, companies using less than two million standard cu ft per 
        day (mmscfd) pay RM24.54 per million metric british thermal unit (mmbtu) 
        of gas.</p>
      <p>Those using more than two mmscfd pay RM32.56 per mmbtu.</p>
      <p>The rubber industry has been the pillar of Malaysia's economy since colonial 
        times, and continues to contribute to export earnings and employment.</p>
      <p>Spurred by the government's industrialisation drive in the 1980s, Malaysia 
        is now the world's top exporter of rubber gloves, catheters and latex 
        threads.</p>
      <p>Malaysian-made gloves account for two-thirds of the global market of 
        180 countries. In 2008, rubber glove makers raked in RM7 billion in export 
        earnings, and last year's performance is likely to be the same.</p>
      <p>The last time the government raised electricity and natural gas rates 
        was on July 1 2008.</p>
      <p>Commercial and industrial users faced a 26 per cent price increase, while 
        smaller businesses like sundry shops, shopowners, small restaurants and 
        cottage industries saw an 18 per cent increase.</p>
      <p>The increases were unavoidable because of record petroleum prices that 
        year. Crude oil hit a peak of US$147 (RM503) a barrel in July, and the 
        price of gas followed suit.</p>
      <p>In August 2008, fuel prices in the international market started to fall. 
        By the last quarter of 2008, prices had plunged by more than 75 per cent 
        to US$35 (RM120) a barrel.</p>
      <p>Following public appeal, the government reduced electricity tariffs by 
        2.54 per cent from March last year. Offices and factories' electricity 
        bills were reduced by 2.7 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. </p>

      <p>Chairman Tan Sri Lim Wee-Chai attributed the continuing profit growth 
        to aggressive marketing strategies and improvement in product productivity 
        and quality.</p>
      <p>&quot;Top Glove is efficient and has adapted well to the chalenging business 
        environment, resulting from cost-saving measures implemented at all factories,&quot; 
        he said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Lim said the group was continuing to strengthen its balance sheet and 
        working capital position, currently in net cash position of RM222 million, 
        with RM237.1 million cash in bank as at Nov 30, 2009.</p>
      <p>&quot;In view of the strong profit growth for the first quarter, the 
        group is optimistic of its future outlook despite ongoing global economic 
        challenges,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;With a diversified range of good quality products offered to a 
        huge customer base spread over more than 180 countries, the group is confident 
        of continuous growth and good profitable performance in the current financial 
        year,&quot; he added. - Bernama</p>

    <td height="31" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p>Top Glove Corp, the world&#8217;s largest 
        rubber-glove maker, said profit almost doubled in its financial first 
        quarter as flu outbreaks bolstered demand for medical products.</p>
      <p>Net income rose to RM65.2 million, or 21.9 sen a share, in the three 
        months ended Nov. 30, from RM34.2 million, or 11.6 sen, a year earlier, 
        the Malaysian company said in a statement to the stock exchange today. 
        Sales rose 22 per cent to RM472.3 million, it said.</p>
      <p>Outbreaks of pandemic influenza around the world this year have raised 
        awareness for healthcare and increased global demand for protective gloves, 
        benefiting Top Glove and other makers. Global demand may reach 140 billion 
        pieces this year, the Selangor-based company said today, without giving 
        any comparison.</p>
      <p>A second wave of the swine flu during the Northern Hemisphere&#8217;s 
        winter season may boost orders, David Chong, an analyst at RHB Research 
        Institute Sdn Bhd wrote in a report today. Top Glove may produce 35.3 
        billion pieces for the year ending Aug. 31, up from 31.5 billion currently, 
        he said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Profit margins remained &#8220;resilient&#8221; in the last quarter even 
        as latex costs increased and the U.S. dollar weakened against the Malaysian 
        ringgit, Chong said.</p>
      <p>The company said its Ebitda margin, which measures earnings before interest, 
        tax, depreciation and amortization against sales, widened to 21.5 per 
        cent in the last quarter from almost 19 per cent in the previous year.</p>
      <p>Its &#8220;strong profit growth&#8221; was the result of &#8220;cost 
        saving measures implemented at all factories, improvements in product 
        quality, productivity, as well as aggressive market strategies,&#8221; 
        the company said in the statement today.</p>
      <p>Top Glove shares fell 0.1 per cent to RM9.52 at 2:23 pm local time in 
        Kuala Lumpur trading after announcing its earnings, while the benchmark 
        stock index declined 0.3 per cent. The stock has more than doubled this 
        year.</p>
      <p>The glove maker has started building its 21st factory in Klang, outside 
        Kuala Lumpur, with construction scheduled to be completed in July next 
        year. The company exports to more than 180 countries.</p>
      <p>Swine flu, also known as H1N1, has spread to more than 208 countries, 
        involving at least 9,596 deaths, since the outbreak began in April, according 
        to World Health Organization figures on December 11. -- Bloomberg</p>

      <p>The counter shot up 25 sen or 2.69% to RM9.55 at 3.15pm. Trading volume 
        was at 333,000 shares at press time or 23.33% higher than Monday. The

      <p>Four brokers issued Buy or Outperform calls on the stock on Dec 15 and

      <p>OSK Research, one of the brokers who issued a report yesterday said &quot;top 
        notch&quot; numbers were expected.</p>
      <p>&quot;Top Glove expects to announce its 1QFY10 results tomorrow, Dec 
        16, which we gather would show a quarter-on-quarter improvement, buoyed 
        by strong demand for rubber gloves, higher glove selling prices, higher 
        utilisation of its plants, its success in passing on costs and ongoing 
        cost cutting and production efficiency.</p>
      <p>&quot;We are upgrading our FY10-11 earnings forecast by 23%-32% on anticipation 
        of the good results and the company's continuing good performance. Maintain

        the company posted a 53.7% increase in net profit to RM169.2 million on 
        revenue that grew 11.2% to RM1.5 billion.</p>
      <p>The company had attributed the strong profit growth for the year to cost

    <td height="31" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> <p><u>Rubber gloves sector</u></p>
      <p> Maintain outperform: Last week, we hosted a rubber glove day which gave 
        around 40 fund managers and buy-side analysts access to the six biggest 
        rubber glove companies in Malaysia &#8212; TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD, 
        SUPERMAX CORPORATION BHD, KOSSAN RUBBER INDUSTRIES BHD, HARTALEGA HOLDINGS 
        BHD, LATEXX PARTNERS BHD and ADVENTA BHD.</p>
      <p>The Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers&#8217; Association (MARGMA) 
        gave the opening remarks and touched on the ABCs of gloves, development 
        of the industry, challenges faced as well as the prospects for the industry. 
        This was followed by four sessions of small group meetings for each of 
        the six firms.</p>
      <p>Demand prospects for rubber gloves remain favourable and some of the 
        manufacturers have even brought forward their expansion plans to cater 
        to the high orders. Factors that could extend the sector&#8217;s re-rating 
        include the continuing uptick in demand from the healthcare industry, 
        ongoing capacity expansion and strong earnings growth. We maintain our 
        overweight stance.</p>
      <p>All the glove stocks under our coverage remain outperform, with Adventa 
        and Supermax staying as our top picks. We raise our earnings forecasts 
        for Adventa and Top Glove by 1% to 10%.</p>
      <p>http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/images/stories/FinancialDaily/10122009/rubber_gloves_2.jpg</p>
      <p>http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/images/stories/FinancialDaily/10122009/rubber_gloves_1.jpg</p>
      <p>The event confirmed the companies&#8217; expansion plans. Adventa and 
        Kossan appear to be the most aggressive in their expansion. Latexx and 
        Supermax have brought forward their expansion plans to cater to the high 
        demand.</p>
      <p><img src="news/New%20Folder/image002.jpg" width="399" height="219"></p>
      <p><img src="news/New%20Folder/image003.jpg" width="400" height="144"></p>
      <p>We were particularly surprised by Adventa&#8217;s plans to add lines 
        with output of up to 36,000 pieces per hour, higher than even the most 
        efficient producer currently, Hartalega, whose latest lines can produce 
        up to 35,000 pieces per hour.</p>
      <p>Hartalega has set its sights on the number one spot in the world for 
        nitrile gloves, a goal which we think is not out of reach.</p>
      <p>Among the issues raised include recent government policies to reduce 
        the number of foreign workers which is a concern. Nevertheless, increasing 
        automation will reduce their reliance on manpower. Glove manufacturers 
        also raised the issue of not having enough supply of natural gas which 
        is the most cost efficient form of energy.</p>
      <p>To reduce their reliance on natural gas, all but Latexx and Kossan are 
        now using biomass facilities.</p>
      <p>The main issue for investors is the possibility of a glut given the industry&#8217;s 
        aggressive expansion. We do not think this is a problem given the strong 
        demand and good long-term prospects in developing countries where per 
        capita consumption is low.</p>
      <p>On top that, MARGMA and the rubber glove companies believe that prospects 
        for the rubber glove industry will continue to improve given the continuous 
        support by the government and the favourable outlook for the demand for 
        rubber gloves. &#8212; CIMB Research, Dec 9</p>

        Most Malaysian CEOs are positive and consider it inevitable.</p>
      <p>IS China&#8217;s status as a rising world power a bad thing? For those 
        who are not necessarily comfortable with the United States hegemony in 
        the global economy, the answer is no, of course. Top Glove Corp Bhd chairman 
        Tan Sri Lim Wee-Chai is one of them.</p>
      <p>&#8220;China serves as a long awaited commercial balance. The current 
        US downturn is a case in point, in which China is leading South-East Asia 
        into growth,&#8221; he says.</p>
      <p>He points out that the world now has China as a huge alternative market 
        to do business with. The resulting trade will generate a lot of spin-off, 
        he adds. The country&#8217;s new-found prosperity offers opportunities 
        for foreign investors.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the world economy gains from investments and consumption 
        by the Chinese.</p>
      <p>Green Packet Bhd chief executive officer Puan Chuan Cheong adopts a similar 
        standpoint.</p>
      <p>He argues: &#8220;China&#8217;s rise is positive. It had supported the 
        world&#8217;s economic growth during last year&#8217;s financial crisis. 
        It is a substantial contributor to the world GDP (gross domestic product), 
        has the biggest output, and presents a massive consumer market that few 
        can ignore.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Plantation consultant Mahbob Abdullah also sees all-round benefits in 
        China&#8217;s economic dynamism. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s very good for 
        everybody that China has become a global economic force. The palm oil 
        industry, for example, has gained because China&#8217;s rising demand 
        for the commodity has opened up the market.</p>
      <p>&#8220;On the other side, the Chinese population&#8217;s nutrient intake 
        improves. Their annual per capita consumption of oils and fats has gone 
        up to 20kg, and there&#8217;s still room to go higher.&#8221;</p>
      <p>These points probably resonate less with people who persistently question 
        China&#8217;s track record on human rights and the impact of the country&#8217;s 
        progress on the environment. However, this criticism has not quite diverted 
        Beijing from its growth strategy.</p>
      <p>In fact, Puan is certainly not alone in believing that China will be 
        the biggest economy in the world in time to come.</p>
      <p>To some extent, China&#8217;s climb to the top of the economic heap draws 
        some comparison with Japan&#8217;s journey to developed nation status, 
        thus breaking the dominance of the Western world.</p>
      <p>Japan too relied on manufacturing goods for the export markets to drive 
        its economic development, gradually moving up the value chain. Like China 
        today, Japan also exported its expertise in building infrastructure to 
        poorer countries, and this was often linked to development aid.</p>
      <p>Many of Japan&#8217;s consumer goods companies started out by churning 
        out copycat products with inferior quality but eventually matured into 
        international brands such as Sony, Toyota and Nintendo. There are signs 
        that this may happen in China as well.</p>
      <p>But there are crucial differences between Japan and China. For one thing, 
        China&#8217;s vast population dwarfs that of Japan. Says Puan, &#8220;Comparing 
        the population size of China and Japan alone, the former&#8217;s economic 
        growth will be substantially greater than that of Japan decades ago.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Top Glove&#8217;s Lim points out that China is unlikely to experience 
        Japan&#8217;s flat growth over the past decade because he believes that 
        China&#8217;s population and domestic consumption will ensure sustainable 
        growth.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Another big difference is that Japanese companies manufacture 
        a lot of their products overseas. China&#8217;s goods are mostly produced 
        in the country and are then shipped overseas,&#8221; he adds.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, there is also the concern that China&#8217;s economic structure 
        is not entirely sound. Says a businessman, who has been involved in a 
        concession-based business in China for several years, &#8220;In the China 
        economic model, efficiency is not always a key objective.</p>
      <p>&#8220;The Chinese are all for public-private partnerships. The government 
        is more than willing to help entrepreneurs with things like generous tax 
        breaks and land allocation. The yuan is also kept low to help exporters.&#8221;</p>
      <p>In Poorly Made In China, his book on his experiences representing importers 
        in South China, Paul Midler wrote: &#8220;Chinese manufacturers had other 
        reasons for being in business, and they operated in a world where economic 
        principles differed.</p>
      <p>&#8220;One aspect that made manufacturing different in China was the 
        symbiotic relationship formed between the export manufacturing sector 
        and government.&#8221;</p>
      <p>The problem with this scenario is that the cosy relationship between 
        the state and state-owned businesses often results in poor financial and 
        operational discipline.</p>
      <p>For now, it appears that the drive, initiative and strategic thinking 
        of the Chinese are sufficient to keep the economy pumping.</p>
      <p>&#8220;The Chinese are very aggressive. When something needs to be done, 
        it will get done. For example, they will work hard to initiate contact 
        with a potential investor,&#8221; says Datuk Lim Hock San, managing director 
        of LBS Bina Group Bhd, a property developer with a presence in Zhuhai 
        in China.</p>
      <p>&#8220;If not directly, they will do so through others, and they will 
        be persistent. They will find a way.&#8221; LBS is a property developer 
        that has a presence in Zhuhai in China.</p>
      <p>While some see the aggressiveness as part of the can-do attitude, others 
        are less appreciative. An executive director of a listed company that 
        ventured into China in 2003 says after the foreign investors come in, 
        they sometimes find that the rules have been changed to protect the local 
        players.</p>
      <p>Says a senior executive of another listed company, &#8220;You often hear 
        about people being cheated in China ventures and about businesses cutting 
        corners because of the get-rich-quick mentality.</p>
      <p>&#8220;But we found that working with the China GLCs (government-linked 
        companies) is a different experience. The Chinese are not fearful of God; 
        they are fearful of their government.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Top Glove Corp Bhd (7113)will continue to raise glove prices, as latex 
        becomes costlier and the US dollar weakens, to maintain profits.</p>
      <p>It last increased the prices in July.</p>
      <p>The company recently posted its best annual net profit since 2001 for 
        fiscal 2009 and doubled dividends. It is also optimistic of keeping its 
        profit margin at more than 10 per cent in the year ending August 2010.</p>
      <p>As the world's biggest glovemaker capable of churning out 31.5 billion 
        pieces and commanding 22 per cent of the global market share, Top Glove's 
        price move is keenly matched by its rivals.</p>
      <p>&quot;Latex prices had started to climb again since July and the US dollar 
        had weakened since September. The combination of these factors have led 
        to higher glove prices,&quot; said chairman and managing director Tan 
        Sri Lim Wee Chai.<br>
        &quot;We need to protect our shareholders' interest,&quot; he told stock 
        analysts and journalists at a briefing in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.</p>
      <p>Raising glove prices is an opportune move as currently global demand 
        outweighs supply. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared influenza 
        A (H1N1) a pandemic four months ago, rubber glovemakers have received 
        more orders, especially from the US and Latin American countries.</p>
      <p>According to WHO, the flu has infected more than 375,000 people throughout 
        the world and claimed more than 4,500 lives since it was first detected 
        in Mexico and the US in late March.</p>
      <p>While some of the 40-odd glovemakers in Malaysia are able to ramp up 
        capacity to meet the sudden demand, most are already running at full capacity 
        around the clock.</p>
      <p>&quot;We continue to receive additional orders from Brazil, Argentina 
        and Mexico,&quot; said executive director Lee Kim Meow.</p>
      <p>In previous years, when supply was more than demand, glovemakers undercut 
        each other by giving discounts. Between 2006 and 2008, Top Glove made 
        a gross profit margin of less than 10 per cent.</p>
      <p>Top Glove's dividend policy is to pay out 30 per cent of profits.</p>
      <p>&quot;Based on the measures we've taken to protect profit margin, we 
        should be able to keep to our dividend policy in the current financial 
        year,&quot; said Lim.</p>

        (Business Times)</strong></p>
      <p>MALAYSIA'S largest glove maker, Top Glove Corporation, plans to reward 
        its shareholders with a bumper dividend payout of 22 sen per share or 
        double the previous year's, following record earnings on the back of surging 
        demand for rubber gloves.</p>
      <p><img src="news/image0012.jpg" width="250" height="159"></p>
      <p><strong><font size="2">H1N1 driven: Top Glove plans to boost its 19 factories 
        by opening two more next year, with 16 production lines targeted for completion 
        in Q1 and 16 more by July</font></strong></p>
      <p>Seen as a natural proxy for the heightened global demand for rubber gloves 
        after the outbreak of the H1N1 virus this year, shares of Top Glove have 
        doubled this year, yesterday rising another 18 sen or 2.25 per cent to 
        RM8.15, versus the benchmark increase of one per cent.</p>
      <p>In line with the industry, Top Glove's earnings have been rising steadily 
        as fear of the H1N1 contagion drove orders. For the last quarter ended 
        August, Top Glove's profit jumped 121 per cent to RM55 million (S$22.5 
        million) on revenue of RM427 million.</p>
      <p>Full-year earnings improved 56 per cent to RM168 million while revenue 
        increased 11 per cent to RM1.53 billion. Earnings per share came to 57.34 
        sen, up from 37.18 sen previously.</p>
      <p>Top Glove's board has recommended a special dividend of six sen a share 
        in addition to the final dividend of nine sen per share, in view of the 
        'good performance and stronger cash flow position' of RM197 million in 
        cash and free cash flow of RM260 million. An interim dividend of seven 
        sen a share had been paid earlier.</p>
      <p>The proposed payout was the highest since the company was listed in 2001 
        and executive chairman Lim Wee-Chai was confident of continued growth 
        and 'good profitable performance' in the current fiscal year.</p>
      <p>Malaysian companies have barely been able to keep up with the surge in 
        demand. Top Glove's plant utilisation came to 90 per cent in the last 
        quarter while others claim near full capacity.</p>
      <p>Where others are cutting back, glove makers are ramping up, albeit cautiously. 
        Top Glove's 19 factories and their 355 production lines already churn 
        out 31.5 billion pieces annually, but the company plans to open two new 
        factories next year, with 16 production lines targeted for completion 
        in the first quarter of next year and another 16 lines by July.</p>
      <p>Even cost increases - owing to higher latex prices - have been successfully 
        absorbed by buyers; with Top Glove having raised its average selling price 
        by 7-11 per cent. Its profit after tax margin for FY09 rose by some 11 
        per cent - only in FY01 has the margin been better at 11.4 per cent.</p>
      <p>Analysts say that its defensive earnings support higher valuations, and 
        Hwang-DBS has raised its target valuation to RM8.50 based on 14 times 
        price earnings.</p>
      <p>Mr Lim, who controls 35 per cent of the company he founded, appears to 
        have taken shareholder feedback to heart. It was at a media and analyst 
        briefing last year that he had solicited views, and found a preference 
        for fatter dividends and more bonus shares.</p>
      <p>Small by global standards, the glove player's market capitalisation now 
        stands at almost RM2.5 billion. Its free float is some 51 per cent.</p>
